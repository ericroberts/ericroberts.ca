# Being a Writer

- Writing goes through stages, editing is the most important
- "How do I make this code better", "well, what pain is it causing you?"
	- code doesn't need to cause pain in the sense that it may be hard to change in future, or actual bugs
	- you can refactor because code is ugly
	- "ugliness" is pain
- assume all code lives forever
- yagni? you might not need it, but once it's out it's there forever	- people still use Instiki
- you write things for other people to read
- you should write code for other people to read
- it's pretty easy to make things work on a case by case basis

- this is a version of flog for writers
- in the same way you should strive to make your writing more readable and understandable, you should do so for your code

"And I guess a lot of what I’m trying to say is don’t accept the idea that you have to get away from elegance, that you have to lose that kind of expressiveness. Instead, leverage the language. Use the tools of the language to make sure that as the complexity of your programs increases, as the complexity of the situations you have to handle increases, your abstractions and your idioms increase [fractally] so that any given part of that big complex system still looks just as beautiful as that 3.times loop."

# Outline

- Programming doesn't suck
	- all code isn't bad
	- I do identify with the things he said
	- They're humourous, but I'm wary of this over acceptance that things have to suck
	- If things suck for you, you should work on makign them better
	- I like programming, I enjoy what I do every day.
	- Do I have frustrating experiences? yes, but that doesn't mean it all sucks

- So good they can't ignore you
	- Mastery
	- Autonomy
	- These factors are what make people like what they do. It's not about what you have passion for right now, it's what you'll have a passion for if you work hard enough.


- Feel bad because you suck
	- always try to get better
	- don't quit because you suck, but make an effort
	- it's not ok to suck
	- everything you make should be beautiful


- Abstractions
	- 3 times do
	- don't accept that more complex problems need to have convoluted solutions
	- "It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty."
		- this is what good abstractions do
	- "Every programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this. Then they're told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who melts it and then all the programmers' snowflakes get dumped together in some inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from falling over."
		- push back on stuff like this
		- you will get more long term value
		- stop prioritizing the short term over long term
